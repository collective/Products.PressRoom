Press Room TODO:

Before initial use:
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

X - Register a stylesheet with the product that can be expanded upon as needed

X - Come up with some good sensible defaults for how the PressRoom is useful OOTB
    X - 0.1 thoughts:
        X - On archetype initialization
            X - Create 3 sub-folders (
                X - Press Contacts (restricted to press contacts), 
                X - Press Release (not restricted, so images and files can be added), 
                X - Press Clips (restricted?)
                X - Prove it w/ tests
            X - Create 3 smart folders one for each of the aformentioned folders if firsttime -- these will be the default item for each folder:
                X - Press Contacts smart folder
                    X - Published
                    X - "public"
                    X - Type
                    X - Sort order getObjPositionInParent
                    X - Prove it w/ test
                X - Press Releases smart folder
                    X - Published
                    X - Sort on effective date, reverse
                    X - Type
                X - Press Clips/In The News smart folder
                    X - Published
                    X - Sort on effective date, reverse
                    X - Type

- Add in multi-lingual support:
    X - LinguaPlone support (attention to Schema needed?)
    X - Add msgids to AT Schema fields
    - Add i18N tags to PTs

- Add license (NB - It'll be GPL'ed) and author information to the product

- Skins improvements
    - Register a new (or a few new) selectable views with page and set the default on for an auto added page to /press-room (Create a nice composity type view for the default "Press Room" view)

- Refine the views for 
    - press release - 
        - I think we should be able to google for some guidlines here, 
        - contacts need to appear to be part of the view not seperate from
        - fix "Press Room" text at the bottom of release
    - press clip - 
    - press contact - disable rss on press contact smart folder
    - press room - default release first view, clip second, contacts to the right view

- Minor tweaks
    - Press Room shouldn't be addable by members, since by definition, you only want 1 per site
    X - Make sure PressRoom folderish object has support for CMFDynamicViewFTI
    X - Make sure we're not accidently re-Titling and re-Descriptitoning the portal
    X - Get kupu settings right
    X - Enable getObjPositionInParent setting w/ the portal_atct tool

- Improvements to core content types:
    - Press Room
        X - Add path query to each press room smart folder on creation, so we're not pulling releases from everywhere on the site
        X - Add a rich body to the PressRoom content type
        - On a press room by press room basis, users should be able to decide how many per type items there will be
        - checkbox for group by view
        - widget querying for unique values of type w/in that path
        - Determine how easy it is to globally disallow the press* types, but then allow them within the pressroom section + every other type
    - Press Contact
        - add image field for portrait of contacts
        
- Create configlet
    - End characters for press release "###" the default
    - Where contacts should show up (i.e. before, after text)

Intermediate term use:
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
- Get some additional views in place
    - Jon had the idea to create a dynamic view which:
        - Query the catalog at root + path/to/press/room for all uniqueValues for Type
        - Loop through each of those unque values and say: "latest images","latest files", "latest press releases", etc.
    - I think initial clients for the press room will drive demand here
- Come up with some good content icons for PressClip & PressRelease
- Documentation for how to administer Press Items (everything else is still too undefined)
- More Tests!
- Look into possibly more suitable widgets for the reuse of publication sources
- Is there a reason that the 'browse contacts' form can't just show all the contacts on the site automatically?

To be determined:
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

- News Item - Disable this on installation? Still not sure.  My gut says no, but when you potentialy have an option to add a Press Release, Press Clip, News Item (and possibly a Blog Entry), will unsophisticated users get confused
- Subheadline - fields should be longer, like description-length, never underestimate the ability for long headlines and subheadlines in press releases :)
