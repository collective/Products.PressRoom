Press Room TODO

Some good ideas
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

[ ] Add i18N tags to PTs 

[ ] Make Press Release and Press Clip subfolders into Large Plone Folders, see 
 http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=12305437 
 for a hint about how to do this
 
- Press Room view 
   [X] Underline on headers looks bad in Plone 2.5. 
   [X] Less indenting on Press Contact description, smaller text.   
   [ ] Make subfolder links relative (ugh!)

- Press Contact
    [ ] add image field for portrait of contacts
    [ ] Add "cell phone" field to press contact, and show in pressrelease and presscontact views
        - in tracker
        
- Press Release
    [X] Make image fit in nicer - clip is fine.
 

[ ] Create configlet for global variables (or maybe just configure per-pressroom in its edit form?)
    [ ] End characters for press release "###" the default
    [ ] Where contacts should show up (i.e. before, after text) ?
    
[ ] Make story date field avaiable to smartfolders
 - in tracker

 	
[ ] Press clip view
	Not sure if linking to original story on publication name is clear
	- in tracker
    
[ ] Better smartfolder listing views for releases, clips & contacts (need to show dates, etc)
 - this requires creating custom templates and then somehow choosing these templates as the default
 view for the folders as they are instantiated.

Intermediate term use:
-----------------------

- Come up with some good content icons for PressClip & PressRelease
- Documentation for how to administer Press Items (everything else is still too undefined)
- More Tests!
- Look into possibly more suitable widgets for the reuse of publication sources
- Is there a reason that the 'browse contacts' form can't just show all the contacts on the site automatically?

To be determined:
-----------------------

- News Item - Disable this on installation? Still not sure.  My gut says no, but when you potentialy have an option to add a Press Release, Press Clip, News Item (and possibly a Blog Entry), will unsophisticated users get confused
- Subheadline - fields should be longer, like description-length, never underestimate the ability for long headlines and subheadlines in press releases :)




Stuff that's already been done
(this is only here for historical purposes)
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=


X - Register a stylesheet with the product that can be expanded upon as needed

X - Come up with some good sensible defaults for how the PressRoom is useful OOTB
    X - 0.1 thoughts:
        X - On archetype initialization
            X - Create 3 sub-folders (
                X - Press Contacts (restricted to press contacts), 
                X - Press Release (not restricted, so images and files can be added), 
                X - Press Clips (restricted?)
                X - Prove it w/ tests
            X - Create 3 smart folders one for each of the aformentioned folders if firsttime -- these will be the default item for each folder:
                X - Press Contacts smart folder
                    X - Published
                    X - "public"
                    X - Type
                    X - Sort order getObjPositionInParent
                    X - Prove it w/ test
                X - Press Releases smart folder
                    X - Published
                    X - Sort on effective date, reverse
                    X - Type
                X - Press Clips/In The News smart folder
                    X - Published
                    X - Sort on effective date, reverse
                    X - Type

- Add in multi-lingual support:
    X - LinguaPlone support (attention to Schema needed?)
    X - Add msgids to AT Schema fields
 
 

- Refine the views for 
    S press release - 
        - I think we should be able to google for some guidlines here, 
        X contacts need to appear to be part of the view not seperate from
        X fix "Press Room" text at the bottom of release
    X press clip - 
    - press contact - disable rss on press contact smart folder
    X press room - default release first view, clip second, contacts to the right view

- Minor tweaks
    X - Press Room shouldn't be addable by members, since by definition, you only want 1 per site
    X - Make sure PressRoom folderish object has support for CMFDynamicViewFTI
    X - Make sure we're not accidently re-Titling and re-Descriptitoning the portal
    X - Get kupu settings right
    X - Enable getObjPositionInParent setting w/ the portal_atct tool

- Improvements to core content types:
    - Press Room
        X - Add path query to each press room smart folder on creation, so we're not pulling releases from everywhere on the site
        X - Add a rich body to the PressRoom content type
        X On a press room by press room basis, users should be able to decide how many per type items there will be
