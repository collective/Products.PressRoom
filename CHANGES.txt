- Changed date & publication spans in pressrom_view to divs [jonstahl]
- Removed "Up one folder" from Press Room subfolder views [jonstahl]
- Made CSS not conditional on pressroom types, that was making it hard to accurately style pressroom subfolders, which aren't custom types [jonstahl]

3.1
- Added basque translation [erral]
- Fixed an upgrade error (issue #42) and the i18n coverage in pressroom_view (issue #43).
- Added a cell phone field to press contacts. Enhanced the way they are displayed throughout the
  Press Room (issue #11). Also Press Contacts can be downloaded as vCards for use in address
  books/email clients. [jbaldivieso]

- moved pressroom_view logic into view [jbaldivieso]
- bifurcated the pressroom_content skin directory into 2.5 and 3.0 versions to
  support KSS in 3.0 sites [jbaldivieso]
- moved as much of the initialization into GenericSetup as possible, without sacrificing
  normal quickinstaller-based installation in Plone 2.5. [jbaldivieso]
- created a workaround for PressRooms created using the new Simple Publication WF.  Users are warned
  if the releases/clips/contacts folders are private, and a button is provided to publish the pressroom,
  the three subfolders, and their respective Collections. [jbaldivieso]

1.0.3

 - Changed the id on the created press contact smart folder from "roster" to "press-contacts" due to the former being a reserver id within the context of a member folder.  Fixes issue #26 [andrewb]
 - Changing some tests that were based on the assumption that we were ordering catalog results on effective rather than the more logical storydate and releaseDate schema fields [andrewb]
 - Adding test coverage to prove that a storydate and releaseDate *should* be required on the PressRelease & PressClip content types due to the sorting that's done in the default catalog queries [andrewb]
 - Making storydate and releaseDate required fields within the schema declaration per the testing coverage in the previous line [andrewb]
 - The "More press clips/release" text only shows up when there actually *are* more of those items [andrewb]
