1.0.3 (SVN/UNRELEASED)

 - Changed the id on the created press contact smart folder from "roster" to "press-contacts" due to the former being a reserver id within the context of a member folder.  Fixes issue #26 [andrewb]
 - Changing some tests that were based on the assumption that we were ordering catalog results on effective rather than the more logical storydate and releaseDate schema fields [andrewb]
 - Adding test coverage to prove that a storydate and releaseDate *should* be required on the PressRelease & PressClip content types due to the sorting that's done in the default catalog queries [andrewb]
 - Making storydate and releaseDate required fields within the schema declaration per the testing coverage in the previous line [andrewb]
 - The "More press clips/release" text only shows up when there actually *are* more of those items [andrewb]
 - Removed trailing slashes in links from main press room and press room subfolder views [jonstahl]
 - Added | between email and phone number for press contacts [jonstahl]
 - Spam-protected email adddress of press contacts [jonstahl]
 - Changed CSS selector for press contacts from #press-contacts to #press-contacts-box to resolve conflict with auto-generated listing in folder_contents [jonstahl]
